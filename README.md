# FROZEN
this is the back up of DDA Zendesk theme

here are the set ups to be aware of when working with front end themes

    In general, No Script functions are suggested to be written on templates, some expections such as $.loadScript function which is defined in
    template, it allows other functions to be called on templates, this function is accessable from all tamplates besides document_head.
    only and always only write functions will be executed on all pages in Script.js or load the function on header/footer templates, depends on situation.

    Global functions and variables are made for easy use, so far the following global functions and vars can be accessed on all templates besides Script.JS and document_head, if a functions needs to access global assets on header, it needs to be plcaed at the end of code blocks

    Global functions, besides the $.loadScript function, currenty google Analytics tracking function ga_tracking() is global. cookie related functions such as read_cookie() will be global in the future release.

    Global variable,
    1.    var the_url= window.location.href; // this variable contains the data of current page url, placed on header
          in many cases, we need url to let functions behave different on sandbox/ prod or different pages, if a function is being loaded on template, this the_url can be directly called or passing through parametere
    2.    var mapObject = JSON.parse(readMap(mapSrc)); // this variable contains Map object for all the ids and etc for sandbox and production, placed on header
          mapObject is being generated by a function on header called readMap(), you dont need to use or understand this fucntion, mapObject is ready for use. 
          to get value from mapObject you need an extra global var called searchKey. 
          How to use mapObject, please check below release note on 12th Novermber 2020, Thursday. 

   
    how to load CSS, JS functions and using DC will be documentated here in coming release (12.nov.2020)
